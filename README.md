# Upland-HA-Addons

A repository for all my Home Assistant addons. Since I host a Minecraft server, many of these are related to hosting one.

## Install

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https://github.com/UplandJacob/Upland-HA-Addons)

## Functional Addons

### [Flask Server](/vscode-tunnel)

Flask is a Python webserver primarily used for testing web applications with APIs, but is an great server for any sort of simple site or API you need.

### [VSCode Tunnel](/vscode-tunnel)

The VSCode Tunnel addon runs a fully featured VSCode tunnel server that can be accessed from [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) and supports all extentions (at least all I have tested with a bit of work). 

`git`, `ssh`, and anything `docker` is supported ('Protection Mode' must be disabled for Docker.) Anything that is stored in `~` (including ssh keys, git configs, etc.) are saved. If you want to install other features, you may use the `vscode-tunnel.sh` file in the config to auto-run on addon startup (this is how I got Hadolint to work).

### [Playit.gg](/playit-gg)

Playit.gg is a global proxy that allows anyone to host a server without port forwarding.

Original inspiration thanks to the Benjamin589 PR williamcorsel/hassio-addons that used the alex33856/playitgg-docker image. The Dockerfile for this addon uses the majority of that Dockerfile.
