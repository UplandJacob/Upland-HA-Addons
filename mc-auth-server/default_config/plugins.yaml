# In this file, plugins (or any other addons) can be defined to be automatically downloaded on addon startup.
#
# Ones in the 'packaged_plugins' section I (UplandJacob) update in the repository so you don't have to.
#   If thosee versions are behind, you can override any part of those with the 'packaged_plugins_overrides' section.
# If Velocity is out of date, or you want another version (you could technically use a different proxy software altogether), you can do that as well with 'velocity_overrides'.
# The 'custom_plugins' section works the same way, but YOU are responsible for updating them yourself.
#
# You can enabled plugins that are disabled by default by using the overrides and setting 'enabled' to 'true'
#   If a plugin was previously enabled and you disable it, '.disabled' will automatically be added to the filename.
#   If you then re-enabled it, '.disabled' will be removed again.
#   If you delete an addon's information entirely (only workes with 'custom_plugins'), it will stay.

# same idea as packaged_plugins_overrides but only for the server
server_overrides: # (don't include the 'server' tag)
#   build: 500 # (example)
custom_plugins: # add your own plugins here
#   example: # DO NOT REUSE IDENTIFIERS! - the current_installed_urls section will have conflicts
#     url: "https://example.com/myplugin-{custom_placeholder}-{version}.jar"
#     custom_placeholder: "custom_value"  # only needed if you have a custom placeholder in the 'url' or 'file'
#     version: 1.0.0  # also optional, only if needed in the 'url'
#     file: "myplugin-{custom_placeholder}.jar"  # REQUIRED - placeholders work here, but if a placeholder changes, the old file WILL NOT be removed.
