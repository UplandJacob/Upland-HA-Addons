# set these if there is a newer version that the addon doesn't know about 
packaged_plugins_overrides: # (or you want to lock to an older version)
  # eaglerxserver: # (example)
  #   version: 1.0.3 # only override the version, the rest will be the packaged_plugins section
  # geyser_extras: # (example: enabling Geyser Extras))
  #   enabled: true

# same idea as packaged_plugins_overrides but only for velocity
velocity_overrides: # (don't include the velocity tag)
  # build: 500 # (example)

custom_plugins: # add your own plugins here
  # example: # DO NOT REUSE IDENTIFIERS! the current_installed_urls section will have conflicts
  #   url: "https://example.com/myplugin-{custom_placeholder}-{version}.jar"
  #   custom_placeholder: "custom_value"  # only needed if you have a custom placeholder in your url
  #   version: 1.0.0  # also optional, only if needed in your url
  #   file: "myplugin-{custom_placeholder}-{version}.jar"  # REQUIRED
