# Redis DB

This addon includes [Redis](https://redis.io) DB, "the world's fastest in-memory database", and has [Redis Exporter](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) built in.

*Inspired by [Fabio Garavini's Redis DB addon](https://github.com/fabio-garavini/hassio-addons/blob/main/redis/) which uses `redis-stack`. This addon uses a Debian base instead to be able to use Redis v8. Redis Insight not included.*
