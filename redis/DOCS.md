# Redis DB

## External access

By default, Redis is only accessible via the internal hostname: `d78ad65c-redis`. To access the Redis database outside of HA, you need to configure the "Database" port in the Configuration tab. **This is not recommended since there is no password**

## Redis Exporter

To access Redis Exporter outside of HA, you need to configure the "Redis Exporter" port in the Configuration tab.
